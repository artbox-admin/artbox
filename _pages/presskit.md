### Features<br>
#### Clean Interface<br>
Artbox features a simple, minimalistic design that's intuitive and refreshing to use. Browse your children's artwork by text or photo. Filter by your favorites, or search for creations by keyword. 

#### Unique Profiles<br>
Create a profile for each child and record their birthday. Each project displays your child's photo, the age they were when they made their creation, and a description of the project and setting. You can browse projects by an individual, or use the Gallery View to see all saved projects. 

#### Edit Entries<br>
Found a typo? Need a better picture? Artbox makes it easy to edit your entries with the tap of a button!

#### Private Repository<br>
Artbox keeps your entries private and secure on your own device, however you have the option to share entries to social media or other apps.

#### Favorites View<br>
We love all our kids the same. But we love some of their artwork more than others! Mark your favorites and easily find them in the Favorites View.

#### Powerful Search<br>
Use the global search to find entries based on the description text. The photo view is instantly updated to show all possibilities.
